This report investigates potential biases in stop-and-search practices by UK police officers,using alternative data, National Statistics, open data from financial year 2020 to 2022. The analysis focuses on the impact of the individual's sex, ethnicity, age group, and the area of the police force. By examining these variables, the study aims to uncover whether these stop-and-search practices are influenced by inherent biases.

Apart from exact figure is different the result conslusion is the same with API data source.

# we set echo=FALSE to suppress code such that it by default does not appear throughout the document.

I did mutation to formalized the format for police force to ensure dataframe  `all_kml_data_update` is ready to do a join with `force_df_sum` based on the column matching ` police_force_area == Name`, so it would include "geometry" to help data virtulisatoin for a map printing.
```{r}
# Update the 'Name' column
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

all_kml_data_update <- all_kml_data %>%
  mutate(Name = gsub("-", " ", Name),           # Replace "-" with space
         Name = gsub(" and ", " & ", Name),     # Replace " and " with " & "
         Name = str_to_title(Name),             # Capitalize each word
         # Handle specific cases
         Name = if_else(Name == "City Of London", "London, City of", Name),
         Name = if_else(Name == "Dyfed Powys", "Dyfed-Powys", Name),
         Name = if_else(Name == "Metropolitan", "Metropolitan Police", Name))

all_kml_data_update

#Now the dataframe `all_kml_data_update` is ready to do a join with `force_df_sum` based on the column matching ` police_force_area == Name`
```


Double check whether all of the forces in the research database could have a match of the boundary data before the join conduction. It is found the original csv file does not contain the data for North Ireland, the official boundary does not contain the geometry of British Transport Police. Therefore, I download data from the archive section of the website and did mutation to ensure it consistent with the data range of other forces. 
```{r}
# Unique names from all_kml_data_update
unique_names <- unique(all_kml_data_update$Name)

# Unique police_force_area from force_df_sum
unique_police_force_areas <- unique(force_df_sum$police_force_area)

# Check unmatched names in both directions
unmatched_names_in_force_df_sum <- unique_police_force_areas[!unique_police_force_areas %in% unique_names]
unmatched_names_in_all_kml_data_update <- unique_names[!unique_names %in% unique_police_force_areas]

# Print unmatched names
print("Unmatched Names in force_df_sum:")
print(unmatched_names_in_force_df_sum)

print("Unmatched Names in all_kml_data_update:")
print(unmatched_names_in_all_kml_data_update)

```


The official boundary does not contain the geometry of British Transport Police. So I did a research by running a web scrapping to collect the introduction and geometry for British Transport Police from Wikipedia. But then I found it is a national special police force that polices the railway network of England, Wales and Scotland. The boundary for it is the whole GB.

```{r,eval=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(RSelenium)
library(rvest)
library("netstat")
library(stringr)
 driver <- rsDriver(browser = "firefox",  port = free_port(random = TRUE), chromever = NULL) 
  remDr <- driver[["client"]]
  url<-"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Transport_Police"
  remDr$navigate(url)
  
  html <- read_html(url)
Intro_BTP <- html%>% html_elements(css=" .mw-content-ltr > p:nth-child(5)" )
Intro_BTP_text <- Intro_BTP %>% html_text() 
Intro_BTP_text

# Scrape Operations jurisdiction information using CSS selector
operations_jurisdiction <- html %>% html_elements(".infobox-data")
operations_jurisdiction <- operations_jurisdiction[html %>% html_elements(".infobox-label") %>% html_text() == "Operations jurisdiction"] %>% html_text()
print(operations_jurisdiction)

      # Scrape Headquarters coordinates using CSS selector
      coordinates <- html %>% html_elements(".geo-default") %>% html_text()
      coordinates <- ifelse(length(coordinates) > 0, coordinates[[1]], "N/A")
      
      # Extract the part after the slash and remove unnecessary characters
coordinates <- sub(".* / ", "", coordinates)
coordinates <- gsub("; ", " ", coordinates)

print(coordinates)

```
Therefore, I would neither use the whole UK boundary to represent or use the headquarter coordinates as they are not meaningful for the research question which aim at the bias, this force operation for the whole UK hence its boundary would cover all of the land.
